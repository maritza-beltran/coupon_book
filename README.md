THIS PROGRAM IS STILL IN PROGRESS, AND IS NOT YET OPERABLE.

The purpose of this program is to create a small database with the coupons that you are gifting to a friend/or family member. 
You will input the types of coupons, how many of each there are, and the recipient should be able to scan the qr code you give them
and access a drop down menu of the coupons they have left. Upon choosing a coupon, they will be able to select the date they want the coupon to be used.
Owner of the coupon book will be able to set minimum date requirements such as "date that the coupon is desired to be used must be at least x days from today's date.
The owner of the coupon book can also add expiration dates to coupons or the entire coupon book.

Once a coupon has been selected and the date has been chosen, given that it fits the criteria the owner has set forth, the owner of the coupon will get a notification 
that the user has chosen to x coupon on x date. The owner can either confirm or deny the request. If the owner confirms the request, then the coupon will be moved to pending.
On the date that the coupon is meant to be used, the owner will get a reminder of the coupon's usage and will be asked if the task has been fulfilled. If it has, the owner should mark
it as such. Once it has been marked as fulfilled, the counter for the coupon will decrease the amount of coupons of that type.

Important features:
The ability to link a list or database of coupons to a link that is accessible through a QR code.
The ability to decrease the count of the type of coupons
